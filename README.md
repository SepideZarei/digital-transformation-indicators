# Digital Transformation Indicators (2020–2023)

👋 Hi, I'm Sepideh. This repository is part of my learning journey in **data science**.  
Here, I explore how different countries have progressed in their **digital transformation** between 2020 and 2023.

## ✨ What this project shows
- Data analysis of 5 countries: UAE, Turkey, Iran, India, and Singapore.
- Metrics such as **Absolute Growth** and **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**.
- A simple but clear comparison of leaders and trends.
- Outputs include:
  - 📊 Excel file (`metrics.xlsx`) with all metrics.
  - 📝 Insights report (`insights.md`) in Markdown format.
  - 📈 Charts (PNG images) showing the trends.

## 🚀 Why I built this
I'm transitioning from a background in **banking and accounting** to **data science**.  
This project is my **first hands-on step** to learn, share, and grow in the community.  
I want to connect with like-minded people who believe in learning, collaboration, and making impact.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Excel / Markdown outputs
- GitHub for sharing and portfolio building

## 🌍 Vision
This is just the beginning. I aim to create more projects around:
- Data science in culture, society, and innovation
- Digital transformation and organizational intelligence
- Open, collaborative knowledge
